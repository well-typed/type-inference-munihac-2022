This is the code accompanying the workshop on implementing
type inference at MuniHac 2022.

The paper I used as a source of the algorithm is
Heeren, Hage and Swierstra:
Generalizing Hindley-Milner Type Inference Algorithms,
which is available from

http://www.cs.uu.nl/research/techreps/repo/CS-2002/2002-031.pdf


If you want to re-do the implementation yourself, then go
to the original branch and start from there.
